Using  *Ethiopia* as a case study:
  
## Change point analysis to quantify the impact of African government policy interventions to slow the spread of COVID-19

### *Business objective*  

The main business objective of this challenge is to quantify the statistical significance of a public health policy introduced by African governments to slow down the spread of COVID-19. 
Situational Overview (Business Need)
The African Union has hired a data science consultant, to gather insights from across the continent on which public health and social measures are most effective at reducing the spread of Covid-19.  The contract states that they are looking for evidence-based insights and they want to learn from existing initiatives launched a competition for all Young African Data Scientists to provide evidence-based insight on the effectiveness of recent public health government policies in the continent as it relates to Covid-19. 

The contract is to investigate the following countries to identify which interventions had the most effect on the Ethiopia under study.  The African Union is looking to the analysis results to both drive policy recommendations to countries in Africa on how to deal with Covid-19 as well as to help countries prepare for future pandemics.

### *Data*

The data that will be used comes from the COVID-19 project by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University.  The python package that comes with the key code (Priesmann et al.) already contains a python class to download the relevant data from John Hopkins database.
